Jin) I have uploaded all the codes even though only s1, s2, and s3 have been modified. (other codes have not been changed since the dissertation submission.) <br/> 

- s1: **Completed** <br/>
  - Confusion matrix and confusion report have been added.<br/>
  - The result can be confirmed here https://github.com/youngmin-jin/python-multi-class-classification-keras-autokeras-comparison/issues/1#issue-1920581046 <br/>
- s2: **Running** (kerastuner 1.3.5)<br/>
  - Confusion matrix and confusion report have been added.<br/>
- s3: **Running** (autokeras 1.0.16)<br/>
  - Might return a different result as "max_trials=1" was set on the previous model..<br/>
  - Confusion matrix and confusion report have been added.
